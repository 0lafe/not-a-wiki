<p><b>Djinn Challenge 1</b></p>
<p><b><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/MiniatureLamps.png" align="middle"> Miniature Lamps</b></p>
<p>In the beginning, we shared with the mortals mystical wishes to give them some entertaining tales to tell.</p>
<p><b>Requirements</b>: Fairy as Base Faction, Djinn as Elite Faction, 135 Reincarnations, Persistent Entropy spell upgrade purchased.</p>
<p><b>Challenge</b>: Reach 185,000 Enchanted Fields within 2 minutes of a new game.</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: Maelstrom increase assistants based on building tiers targeted. Provides a better bonus for lower tier buildings.</p>
<p><b>Formula</b>: Multiplicative to base assistants: sum of ((12-T) * 100 )%, each T is tier of targeted maelstrom building.</p>
<p><b>Alternative Formula</b>: ((36-x-y-z) * 100)%, where x,y and z are the respective tiers of Maelstrom’s target buildings.</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: Fairy Chanting produces Limited Wish casts every second based on maximum mana. Casts provided increase progressively over Fairy Chanting duration.</p>
<p><b>Additive to LW casts</b>: (0.0001 * (x ^ 0.4) * y * z), where x = maximum mana, y = Fairy Chanting tier, z = Fairy Chanting runtime (seconds).</p>
<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Good for Fairy</p>

<p><b>Djinn Challenge 2</b></p>
<p><b><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/IfritIgnition.png" align="middle"> Ifrit Ignition</b></p>
<p>As the years passed through, this benevolence fell on deaf ears. The mortals decided to enslave us; dictate to us their every whim. How dare they command us to do their bidding, give them hell!</p>
<p><b>Requirements</b>: Demon as Base Faction, Djinn as Elite Faction, 139 Reincarnations, Djinn Bloodline active, Completion of Djinn Challenge 1.</p>
<p><b>Challenge</b>: Have at least 6 T (6e12) Mana Produced within 6 hours of a new game.</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: Limited Wish casts count more based on Hellfire Blast casts in this game.</p>
<p><b>Formula</b>: Multiplicative: (0.6 * x ^ 0.4), where x is Hellfire Blast casts (this game).</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: Each time you cast an Evil spell, you gain additional casts equal to the amount of trophies you have.</p>
<p><b>Formula</b>: Additive: (x ^ 0.7), where x is number of trophies. Applies only for real evil spells, adds casts directly to the spell’s casts.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Good for Demon</p>

<p><b>Effect</b>: Catalyst casts one additional spell.</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: Makes Limited Wish scale faster based on Research Points used in this game.</p>
<p><b>Formula</b>: (y = ln(1 + sum of x))%, where x =  all selected researches' number (e.g. W275 = 275)</p>
<p><b>Formula</b>: y converted to a multiplier (so 5% = 1.05) is applied to both exponents of LW: ( (2.25 * ln(1+a) ^ (1.35 * y)) * (b^(0.45 * y)), where a= duration, b = casts.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Good for Faceless</p>
