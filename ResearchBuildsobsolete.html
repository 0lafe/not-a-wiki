<p>Relies on Brainwave challenge upgrade to produce huge amount of assistants. With two 1-day runs I completed R28 in two days and with total time of 4 days in R29 I went from 400 Qitg (4e110) to 4 Sptg (4e114) gems with a 2-day run. Since you dont need any assistant upgrades, there is some wiggle room in what upgrades to buy. From those you need one for FC (C105, C250, C400, D150, A400) and 1-2 mana upgrades (S30, S105, D135, A300)</p>

<p>You can get x1000 gems even without Miracle (swap D400 for D245), but if you want to use it then buy only Farms, Alchemist Labs, Sunken Cities and Halls of Legend to make the production phase less random.</p>
<p>Dont buy D200 and D330 before going into production phase. Headstart is 1 minute + 2 seconds per cast of Brainwave, or roughly 5 minutes per day, the assistants gained by S375 are time in minutes square.</p></div>

<p><b>Range</b>: to 1 Sp (E24) gems
<p><b>Bloodline</b>: Druid
<p><b>Spellcraft</b>: 10, 105/400, 150, 330/460, 500

<p><b>Warfare</b>: 120, 150, 320, 330, 400
<p><b>Notes</b>:
<p>Autocast God's Hand and Tax Collection for buildup. Add Diamond Pickaxe for S460. A long income phase following a shorter buildup is recommended.
<p><b>12+ hours</b>: D175 E480.
<p><b>24+ hours</b>: S400 S460 D175 E30 E480.
<p>S400: Take S400 if it provides more than 2500 max mana.
<p>S460: S460 growth varies inversely with spell duration. It takes 18 hours to catch up to S330 if God's Hand duration is 40 seconds. 9 hours if God's Hand duration is 20 seconds.
<p>E480: E480 should be higher than E200 by 150,000 total spells cast.
<p>D480: Use D480 if your time between the 3 alignments will be relatively balanced during the run.
<p>C460 requires clicks to grow (it can grow past C120 quickly.) Take C120 and C500 as alternatives to C460 and C135 if you don't want to click.</p></div>

<p><b>Description</b>: This build relies on previously buffing time spent as evil, spells cast, and possibly mana produced. Very high production following a run for the Archwizard trophy.
<p><b>Requires</b>: Several days spent as evil. Drow challenge 5 completed. Best with 10 billion mana produced.
<p><b>Buildup runs</b>: The Works by Deworx or Ascended Goblins (Druid bloodline) in this section.
<p><b>Bloodline</b>: Demon
<p><b>Upgrades</b>: 
<p><b>Spellcraft</b>: 105, 150, 330, 400, 500/200
<p><b>Craftsmanship</b>: 135/105, 150, 330, 340, 460

<p><b>Alchemy</b>: 105, 120, 150, 270/305/375, 330, 400
<p><b>Warfare</b>: 120, 150, 320, 330, 350
<p><b>Notes</b>: 
<p>Upgrade selections assume E480 is high and S400 is higher than S500.
<p>D150 and A270 are recommended. Only take A305 if C105 and D150 are not taken. A375 can replace A270 if S400 is less than 7000 (7000 as a crossover point is a guess.)
<p>Taking the time for a buildup run is not recommended before R43.</div>

<p>Most of the Archwizard builds out there were made before Prestige challenges were introduced. This one has been adjusted to work with the challenges. I started with "The Works" build and replaced some upgrades with production upgrades (to get more Goblin Banks) and added C250. My results were quite good - I finished my Archwizard run in less than 9 days, 6 hours. I started this at R39 with a gem count of 1.876e148. I had around a 4k max mana bonus to start with on S400. I do not have any of the gifts and did not use timewarps. I did scry a little (maybe a couple dozen times over the course of the run), but I'm not sure whether that would make a noticeable difference in the length of the run. I stopped casting combo strike when my mana regen exceeded my max mana. I think I might have been able to get away with fewer production upgrades, since I got to the required number of Goblin Banks in 12 minutes.
<p>100% Obsoleted by The Works (1.6.53.0)
<p><b>Important</b>: To work, this build needs all the prestige challenges done.
<p><b>Faction</b>: Goblin
<p><b>Bloodline</b>: Druid
<p><b>Note</b>: Wait until S50 gives at least 10 TC's before joining Drow.
<p><b>Upgrades</b>:
<p><b>Spellcraft</b>: 30, 50, 105, 400, 500
<p><b>Craftsmanship</b>: 105, 120, 150, 250, 330
<p><b>Divine</b>: 135, 200, 290, 480 (perhaps D400 instead if D480 bonus is low), 560
<p><b>Economics</b>: 30, 135, 145, 225, 250, 590
<p><b>Alchemy</b>: 105, 120, 270, 305, 400
<p><b>Warfare</b>: 25, 135, 150, 205, 250, 400, 520
<p>Autocast all spells to get production to set up the build; when you get to at least 5417 Goblin Banks and join Drow, switch to BF and CS on bronze, TC on silver. (When your mana regen is higher you can switch TC to gold autocast.) This build produces lots of FC - I had the "Trillion Faction Coin Trophy" within no more than 6 hours of starting the run.
<p><b>Author Notes</b>: My final results were: Time: 9 days, 5 hours, 45 minutes Spells cast: 1e9 Max Mana: 335 Mana Regen: 338 Assistants: 9553 Total FC found: 6.291e17 Total Royal Exchanges bought: 3680
<p><b>Non-Author Notes</b>: Check D55, I'm pretty sure it will always be greater than D400 or D480 when doing a spell casting build.
