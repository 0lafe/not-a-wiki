###### Secret Trophies

Secret trophy icons and tool-tips only become visible once you have completed them.

Each rewards a Secret Upgrade which shows up in the upgrades tab, and in the current game, as soon as you approach their total cost.

To get information on the effects of trophy upgrades, see the Upgrades page.

All upgrades bought with gold pre-Ascension are free post-Ascension.

Most of the information below comes from this **[forum](http://www.kongregate.com/forums/8945-realm-grinder/topics/522336-full-hidden-trophy-list/)** post , created by Rahler.
