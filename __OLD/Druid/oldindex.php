<p><b>Druid Challenge 1</b></p>
<p><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/SilentAssistanceChallenges.png" alt="Silent Assistance" align="middle"> <b>Silent Assistance</b></p>
<p>The ancient druids request evidence that you are a servant of balance before your inclusion to their ranks.</p>
<p><b>Requirements</b>: 4 Reincarnations, Halls of Balance spell upgrade, Elf 1 and Demon 1 challenges completed
<p><b>Challenge</b>: Make the building targeted by Grand Balance surpass 99.9% of your production.</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: Animal Companions (1,2) works faster</p>
<p><b>New Formula</b>: floor((sqrt(1 + 16 * x) - 1) / 2), where x is your Playtime (This Game) stat in hours.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Good for Druid</p>
<p><b>Tips</b>:
<p>Make sure your least-producing building still makes up a large proportion of your production (2% and up). This will necessarily balance the production of each of your other buildings around 9.09% (= 1/11). Upgrade buildings only as required to balance them. Building more Farms, Inns and Blacksmiths will increase the multiplier of the final cast of Grand Balance.</p>

<p><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/BalancedCurrentChallenges.png" alt="Balanced Current" align="middle"> <b>Balanced Current</b></p>
<p>Our sorcerers are desperately trying to stabilize the balance of the realm, this is your opportunity to gain their favor - and live another day.</p>
<p><b> Requirements</b>: 9 Reincarnations, Druid Bloodline, Elf 2 and Demon 2 challenges completed
<p><b>Challenge</b>: Have exactly 1600 of each building types, for 16 full Grand Balance casts. (The 16 casts only counts after you have all the 1600 buildings.)</p>

<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Good for Titan</p>
<p><b>----------------------------------</b>
<p><b>Druid Challenge 3</b></p>
<p><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/EldritchArchitectureChallenges.png" alt="Eldritch Architecture" align="middle"> <b>Eldritch Architecture</b></p>
<p>Pleased with your efforts, the elder druids assigned you with an important task; empower our obelisks, sacred churches and sarcophaguses.</p>
<p><b>Requirements</b>: 19 Reincarnations, 1000 excavationsElf 3 and Demon 3 challenges completed
<p><b>Challenge</b>: Have Grand Balance target Stone Pillars, Monasteries and Ancient Pyramids in that order, for 3 casts of the Grand Balance spell.</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: You gain 1 additional max mana for every 4 Labyrinths owned.
<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Good for Faceless</p>

<p>2.Buy Max Stone Pillars and Max Alchy Labs > Cast Grand Balance</p>
<p>3.Buy Max Monasteries, Max Labys, and Max Iron Strongholds > Cast Grand Balance.</p>
<p><b>----------------------------------</b>
<p><b>Druid Challenge 4</b></p>
<p><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/OverflowingManaChallenges.png" alt="Overflowing Mana" align="middle"> <b>Overflowing Mana</b></p>
<p>The Druids need more spell power, but they are worried about outside influences throwing off their balance</p>
<p><b>Requirements</b>: 25 Reincarnations, Druid Unique Building
<p><b>Challenge</b>: Cast 13 Grand Balances in the first 5 minutes of a playthrough with 0 non-Druid researches.</p>
<p><b>Effect</b>: All spell durations increased by 1% for every 1,000 max mana</p>
<p><b>Upgrade</b>: Good for All</b>
<p><b>Tips</b>
<p>Do not buy Halls of Balance as it increases the spell duration. Make sure you have some excavations to buy the Heritages. (Angel Heritage and Angel 1 challenge both boost your m/s.) To acheive this, you need a min. of 50 m/s with Grand Balance continuously casting during 13 full casts. Reward given at 5 minute mark regardless of when achieved.</p>

<p><b>In-Game Challenge Final Reward</b>
<p><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/PrimalBalanceChallenges.png" alt="Primal Balance" align="middle"> <b>Primal Balance</b></p>
