<p><img src="http://musicfamily.org/realm/Factions/picks/LegendaryAnticsChallenges.png" alt="Efficient Magic" align="middle"> <b>Legendary Antics</b></p>
<p>The Princes of Hell demand a tribute, unleash the beast by extorting every other faction in this realm. You should perform this task with haste, for they are well known for their impatience</p>

<p>High gem and low Excavations (relative). Work up enough coins to excavate 96 REs, until the number says "(96)", and then buy 1 or 2 more to get exactly 666. Don't buy Demon exchanges. Drow's blackmail upgrade helps the challenge, and the exchanges don't have to be spread evenly.</p>
